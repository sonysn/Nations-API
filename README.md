# Welcome to the Nations API

This is a simple API that provides information about different nations of the world.

## Usage

The API provides information about nations in the JSON format. By default, it returns the name of the nation, its currency symbol, and flag.

You can make a request to the following endpoint to get information about all nations:

`GET /api/v1/welcome/getdata`

The response will be a JSON array containing information about all the nations in the database. Here's an example:

```
[
  {
    "name": "Nigeria",
    "symbol": "$",
    "flag": "greenwhitegreen"
  },
  {
    "name": "United States",
    "symbol": "$",
    "flag": "starsandstripes"
  },
  ...
]
```
